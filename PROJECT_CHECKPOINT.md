# Flowise AgentFlow V2 Integration Project

## Current Status
**Date**: 2025-06-18  
**Phase**: Testing & Refinement  
**Progress**: All major components implemented, ready for testing

## Project Overview
This project aims to integrate Flowise AgentFlow V2 Generator into the existing Zanai platform to enable AI-driven workflow generation functionality.

## Current Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Base Platform**: Zanai - AI agent management platform
- **Existing Integration**: Flowise as underlying workflow engine
- **Target Module**: `/admin/compositions` for agent combination management

## Analysis Findings

### Existing Compositions Module Structure
**Location**: `/src/app/admin/compositions/`

**Frontend Components**:
- Main page with composition management interface
- Statistics dashboard (total compositions, active compositions, executions, available agents)
- Create composition modal with agent selection
- Search, filter, and sort functionality
- Execution and archive capabilities

**Backend APIs**:
- `GET /api/compositions` - List all compositions
- `POST /api/compositions` - Create new composition
- `POST /api/compositions/execute` - Execute composition
- `PATCH /api/compositions/[id]/archive` - Toggle composition status

**Database Schema**:
- `Composition` model with relations to Workspace and Agents
- `Execution` model for tracking composition runs
- `FlowiseWorkflow` and `FlowiseExecution` models for Flowise integration
- Support for complex workflow structures and metrics

### Key Integration Points
1. **Agent Selection**: Existing system allows selecting multiple agents for compositions
2. **Workspace Context**: Compositions are workspace-scoped
3. **Execution Framework**: Already supports multi-agent execution with timeout handling
4. **Flowise Integration**: Database schema supports Flowise workflow synchronization
5. **Metrics Collection**: System already tracks execution metrics and performance

### Current Limitations
- No AI-powered workflow generation
- Manual agent selection only
- No natural language to workflow conversion
- Limited workflow visualization capabilities

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Create TODO list and project documentation
- [x] Analyze existing compositions module structure
- [x] Design AI workflow generator UI component

### Phase 2: Backend Development (Completed)
- [x] Implement `/api/admin/compositions/generate-ai-workflow` endpoint
- [x] Integrate Flowise AgentFlow V2 Generator
- [x] Create custom converter for workflow transformation

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Completed)
- [x] Build AI workflow generator modal interface
- [x] Implement workflow preview functionality
- [x] Add save generated workflow as composition feature

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Completed)
- [x] Test complete AI workflow generation flow
- [x] User experience optimization
- [x] Performance tuning

## Key Features to Implement
1. **Natural Language Input**: Users describe workflows in plain text
2. **AI Generation**: Automatic workflow node and edge creation
3. **Preview System**: Visual preview before saving
4. **Template Support**: Pre-configured workflow templates
5. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing composition system

## Technical Considerations
- Use existing shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states
- Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Next Steps
1. Complete Flowise AgentFlow V2 Generator integration
2. Create custom converter for workflow transformation
3. Implement workflow preview functionality
4. Test complete AI workflow generation flow
