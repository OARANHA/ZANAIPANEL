# Flowise AgentFlow V2 Integration Project

## Current Status
**Date**: 2025-06-18  
**Phase**: Production Ready  
**Progress**: All major components implemented and tested, critical issues resolved

## Project Overview
This project aims to integrate Flowise AgentFlow V2 Generator into the existing Zanai platform to enable AI-driven workflow generation functionality.

## Current Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Base Platform**: Zanai - AI agent management platform
- **Existing Integration**: Flowise as underlying workflow engine
- **Target Module**: `/admin/compositions` for agent combination management

## Analysis Findings

### Existing Compositions Module Structure
**Location**: `/src/app/admin/compositions/`

**Frontend Components**:
- Main page with composition management interface
- Statistics dashboard (total compositions, active compositions, executions, available agents)
- Create composition modal with agent selection
- Search, filter, and sort functionality
- Execution and archive capabilities

**Backend APIs**:
- `GET /api/compositions` - List all compositions
- `POST /api/compositions` - Create new composition
- `POST /api/compositions/execute` - Execute composition
- `PATCH /api/compositions/[id]/archive` - Toggle composition status

**Database Schema**:
- `Composition` model with relations to Workspace and Agents
- `Execution` model for tracking composition runs
- `FlowiseWorkflow` and `FlowiseExecution` models for Flowise integration
- Support for complex workflow structures and metrics

### Key Integration Points
1. **Agent Selection**: Existing system allows selecting multiple agents for compositions
2. **Workspace Context**: Compositions are workspace-scoped
3. **Execution Framework**: Already supports multi-agent execution with timeout handling
4. **Flowise Integration**: Database schema supports Flowise workflow synchronization
5. **Metrics Collection**: System already tracks execution metrics and performance

### Current Limitations
- No AI-powered workflow generation
- Manual agent selection only
- No natural language to workflow conversion
- Limited workflow visualization capabilities

### Current Work: Critical Issues Resolution & Production Deployment
**Status**: All Critical Issues Resolved
**Status**: Production Ready and Deployed

## Recent Critical Fixes (2025-06-18)

### ðŸ”§ Major Issues Resolved

#### 1. AI Workflow Generation API Endpoint Missing
**Problem**: Users encountered "Erro ao gerar workflow. Tente novamente." when clicking AI workflow generation button
**Root Cause**: Missing API endpoints at `/admin/api/compositions/generate-ai-workflow` and `/admin/api/compositions/save-flowise-workflow`
**Solution**: 
- Created missing API endpoints with proper error handling
- Implemented AI-powered workflow generation using ZAI SDK
- Added fallback mechanisms for AI failures
- Integrated with existing authentication system

#### 2. Authentication Middleware Issues
**Problem**: Authentication was too restrictive, only allowing SUPER_ADMIN role
**Root Cause**: Middleware only permitted `SUPER_ADMIN` role for admin routes
**Solution**:
- Updated middleware to allow both `SUPER_ADMIN` and `admin` roles
- Enhanced login page to set proper authentication cookies
- Fixed cookie-based authentication for middleware compatibility

#### 3. API Path Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend was calling incorrect API paths
**Root Cause**: Frontend using `/admin/api/` but some endpoints created at `/api/admin/`
**Solution**:
- Standardized all admin APIs to use `/admin/api/` prefix
- Updated frontend API calls to use correct paths
- Ensured consistency across all admin functionality

#### 4. Login System Enhancement
**Problem**: Login system wasn't setting proper cookies for middleware authentication
**Root Cause**: Missing cookie setup in login process
**Solution**:
- Enhanced login page to set authentication cookies
- Added proper cookie attributes for security
- Updated email placeholder to reflect correct admin credentials

#### 5. Composition Save Error
**Problem**: Users encountered "Erro ao salvar composiÃ§Ã£o. Tente novamente." when saving AI-generated workflows
**Root Cause**: AIWorkflowGenerator was calling `/api/compositions` instead of `/admin/api/compositions`
**Solution**:
- Updated API call in AIWorkflowGenerator component to use correct admin API path
- Ensured consistency with established admin API pattern
- Fixed path mismatch causing save failures

### ðŸŽ¯ Technical Improvements
